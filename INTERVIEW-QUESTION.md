#### Sqoop-Big-Data

- **Apache Sqoop** is a tool in the Hadoop ecosystem designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between structured data stores (like RDBMS) and Hadoop ecosystems (like HDFS, Hive, HBase).

- From RDBMS → Hadoop: Import data from MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. into HDFS, Hive, HBase.
- From Hadoop → RDBMS: Export data from Hadoop back to relational databases.
